<body>
SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization and is the process of improving a website's visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs) to attract more organic (unpaid) traffic. By optimizing content, technical aspects, and website authority, businesses can increase their chances of appearing higher in search results when users search for relevant products or services, ultimately leading to more visitors and brand awareness. 
Why is SEO important?
Increased Visibility:
Users discover content and businesses by searching on engines like Google, and SEO helps you appear in those results. 
More Traffic:
Higher rankings lead to increased visibility, which drives more organic (non-paid) visitors to your website. 
Better User Experience:
SEO involves making your site more appealing to both users and search engines, improving overall site performance and accessibility.
